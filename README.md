# car-price-prediction


This project focuses on predicting the prices of used cars using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset containing various features of used vehicles, the model aims to estimate car prices with high accuracy, helping both buyers and sellers make data-informed decisions.

## Project Overview

The project involves:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Price prediction using supervised learning algorithms

## Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:
- Make and model
- Year of manufacture
- Mileage
- Engine size
- Transmission type
- Fuel type
- Number of doors
- Tax and MPG
- Price (target variable)

(Data source: [Include dataset source or mark as proprietary if applicable])

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation

## Models Applied

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost (optional: include if used)
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
